# KeikoInnovation

We are a software development organisation that aims to build software that makes people's lives easier. We are focusing on software that aims to simplify planning of events and happenings that makes people come together physically. Our philosophy is that if you can spend less time doing the boring part of the planning, you can use more time on planning the fun stuff, or get spare time to do more planning of other fun events. 

KeikoInnovation is founded in Norway by Per Christian Kofstad
